# Mutable Subjects
*for corporeal and virtual marimbas*
composed and created by Tucker Johnson

## Program note
*Mutable Subjects* is a work performed entirely from a custom supercollider program. The piece begins with the presentation of two pitch collections, one by the human performer, and one by the computer. Properties of the relationship between these collections are used by the supercollider program to structure improvisation into  discreet sections in the piece. It is highly unlikely that any two performances of this work will share the same structure. The human and the virtual marimba player do not share the same access to this structure, as the human player has to interpret the same kinds of material the virtual performer feels.

The title *Mutable Subjects* has many meanings, referring to the possibility for different collections to structure the work, as well as to the ways I intend to refine and grow this piece. The virtual marimba player being just as liable to change as the living ones, who may approach the piece. There is also the pun, of the piece being able to be muted at any time from the computer.


## Performance instruction

To start the program open MutableSubjects.scd in supercollider. Select "language" from the drop-down menu, and choose "Evaluate file." The program window will open.

At the outset of the piece the performer is asked to play and select a pitch collection. After clicking the arrow, the virtual performer will select a pitch collection of the same size. As soon as the virtual player finishes playing this collection, the piece will begin.

The performer should improvise with the pitch-classes displayed in black with a white, which can be performed in any octave. The blacked out pitch classes should not be played. Two sliders are provided to help suggest note density, and dymanic. These sliders suggest an average point, but the surface of the improvisation should not remain consistent, but wander around these points. Dynamic is notated as p(piano), m(mezzo), and f(forte), with the slider suggesting a smooth linear space between these markings. Density is suggested as notes-per-second, the linear space being between 5 notes-per-second and one note every 5 seconds, with 1 note-per-second in the center.

The performer should feel free to get creative in the improvisation--the virtual performer is rarely playing the same density and dymanic as the human. The piece should create a sonic and semantic push and pull between the performers.
