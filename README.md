## Program note
*Mutable Subjects* is a work performed entirely from a custom supercollider program. The piece begins with the presentation of two pitch collections, one by the human performer, and one by the computer. Properties of the relationship between these collections are used by the supercollider program to structure improvisation into  discreet sections in the piece. It is highly unlikely that any two performances of this work will share the same structure. The human and the virtual marimba player do not share the same access to this structure, as the human player has to interpret the same kinds of material the virtual performer feels.

The title *Mutable Subjects* has many meanings, referring to the possibility for different collections to structure the work, as well as to the ways I intend to refine and grow this piece. The virtual marimba player being just as liable to change as the living ones, who may approach the piece. There is also the pun, of the piece being able to be muted at any time from the computer.


## Performance instruction

To start the program open MutableSubjects.scd in supercollider. Select "language" from the drop-down menu, and choose "Evaluate file," or right-click in the document and select "select all" the press shift+enter to evaluate. The program window will open.

At the outset of the piece the performer is asked to select then play a pitch collection.
After clicking the arrow, the virtual performer will select a pitch collection of the same size.
As soon as the virtual player finishes playing this collection, section 1 of the piece will begin.

The performer should improvise with the pitch-classes displayed in any octave.
The blacked out pitch classes should not be played.
Two sliders are provided to help show attack density, and dymanic.
The surface of the improvisation should not remain fixed on these values, rather it should wander around these points.
Dynamic is notated between p(piano) and f(forte), with the slider suggesting a smooth linear space between these markings.
Density is notated as the number of attacks per 5 seconds.
The minimum density is 1 attack every 5 seconds and the maximum is 17 attacks every 5 seconds.

The provided pitch classes and slider values will change in each section of the piece.
The current section is displayed at the top of the window.
The duration of each section is displayed on the right side of the window, with the complete duration of the piece in the top right corner.
When a new section is coming up, the check box will flash. Once the box is checked the next section will begin.
